Accounts management
==============
This is a project for Software Engineering that myself and three others participated in as our 2nd year group project.
Code created by myself can be viewed inside the folders labelled "Security" and "Clients". 
The folders can be found in 'src/ie/ncirl/softeng'. I do not however take credit for one file in the security folder called
"SubsystemsGui" as this was made by another student.

If testing my apps then the following will be needed to log in:

    Client ID = "TeamAwesome";
    Text Password = "softengproject";
    PIN/Six Digit Password = 634197;
    
Logging into the admin terminal is handled differently, to do so, enter the following:

/login TeamAwesome 634197

Once this has been done you will be able to use the admin terminal commands to add and modify user accounts.
